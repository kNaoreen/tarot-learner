## Troubleshooting

### JavaScript: use print statements

You can use `console.log("SOMETHING GOES HERE")` in JavaScript anywhere in the program to test if lines of code are being hit.

Aside from strings, you can pass basically anything into the parameter list of of `console.log()` to verify things about your program. For example, you can use it to check what the values of different variables are:

```
function myFunction(myParameter) {
  console.log(myParameter);
}
```

You can print an arbitrary amount of things in a single print statement.

`console.log("THIS IS A STRING", {}, 1 + 1)`
